- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 
  The **vehicle length**, and **vehicle ground clearance** provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.T values are relatively far away from zero       which indicate a relationship exists and these two variables have significant impact on mpg.
  
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
  The **p-value: 5.35e-11** is much smaller han the assumed significance level of 0.05%.This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis and the slope of     the linear model is not zero.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  This linear model has **R-squared:  0.7149**, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. This model  predict mpg of              MechaCar prototypes effectively.
 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
##### Total manufacturing lot

##### Individual manufacturing lot

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The Variance for entire manufacturing lot is 62.293 which meets the current manufacturing design specification. The Variance for Lot1 is 0.9795 and Lot2 is 7.4693 and these two lots also meet the design specification. However Variance for Lot3 is 170.286 which exceeds the limit of 100 pounds per square inch and therefore Lot3 of suspension coils may not be accepted.
